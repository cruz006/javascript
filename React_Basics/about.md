# About React and Next.js

This is from [Nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/what-is-react-and-nextjs#building-blocks-of-a-web-application)
I will be using this markdown file to create a guide as i progress to next.js

---

I will structure it as each markdown file will be each chapter from the website. Actually this would make this folder a reference sheet.
