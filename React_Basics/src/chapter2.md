# Chapter 2 - Rendering User Interfaces (UI)

This rule is triggered whenever raw HTML is used in a Markdown document:

Browsers interpret and then render your files to show what is the website.
This is an example of how it is interpreted.

- **DOM** - is like a tree structure that represents a web page in a computer's memory. Each part of the web page, such as text, images, and buttons, is a "node" in this tree. It allows programs, like JavaScript, to interact with and change the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically. So, the DOM is a way for code to talk to and modify what you see on a website in real-time. Learn more about the DOM [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
